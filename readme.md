# Task Tracker

This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application for managing tasks.

## Features

- Add new tasks with a unique ID and store it in `JSON` format.
- List tasks by their status: `to-do`, `in-progress`, or `done`.

- Delete tasks by their ID.
- Mark tasks as `in-progress` or `done`.
